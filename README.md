### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned:

- How to use the <hr /> tag properly (thanks to MDN).

- How to apply the :not pseudo-class in CSS to style specific elements efficiently.

Exemples:

```html
<hr />
```

```css
tbody:not(:first-child) {
  border-top: 4px dashed hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
}
```

### Continued development

Next, I would like to deepen my understanding of:

- Media queries for building fully responsive designs.
- Relative units in CSS to improve scalability across different screen sizes.

If you have any resources that could help me, please feel free to share!
